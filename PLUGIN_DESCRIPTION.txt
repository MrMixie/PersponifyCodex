Persponify Codex — Local Studio Companion (CLI-First)

Persponify Codex links Roblox Studio to a local Codex workflow. The plugin
applies changes; the server + Codex CLI handle planning and generation.

Get the companion repo:
https://github.com/MrMixie/PersponifyCodex

Quick setup:
1) Install this plugin.
2) Download the repo and start the launcher (local server on 127.0.0.1:3030).
3) In Studio, open the plugin and click Connect.
4) Register MCP once:
   codex mcp add persponify --url http://127.0.0.1:3030/mcp
5) Run Codex in the repo and type: sync context

Highlights:
- Local-only; no external hosting required.
- Safe apply pipeline (undo waypoints, guarded deletes).
- Context export (diff/full), missing-source hints, and semantic tagging.
- Actions: create/move/rename/delete, set properties/attributes, edit scripts.

Notes:
- Plugin scripts live in Studio only; this repo stores the server + launcher.
- License: MIT. Updates and downloads are on GitHub Releases.
